what?
a code copilot that allows python developers to build cross platform software using pure python with generative AI features ranging from code to UI components. Think of it like a combination of Cursor, Devin, v0, and phind

how?
we're gonna use flet as the base UI library running flutter under the hood. and use LLMs with context from the codebase and internet search access and chain of thought methods.

why?
cuz python developers lives matter

how it will look like?
it'll be a small panel on the right of your favorite code editor in a non invasive sort. It'll have a prompt bar and some space for the conversation.
