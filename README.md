# AI Software Engineering Assistant

This project is an AI-powered chat interface designed to assist software engineers in rapidly building cross-platform applications. It uses the Flet framework for the UI and the Neurum AI for generating responses.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface
- AI-powered responses for software engineering queries
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/somethingcool.git

3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command in the project directory:

python main.py

This will launch the chat interface. You can then type your software engineering questions or requests, and the AI will provide responses to assist you.
