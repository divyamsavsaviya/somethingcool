# AI Python Application Builder User Guide

## Introduction

The AI Python Application Builder is a powerful tool designed to help users create Python applications using simple instructions. It provides an interactive chat interface where you can describe the application you want to build, and the AI will generate the corresponding Python code.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have installed the application following the instructions in the README.md file.
2. Run the application using `python main.py`.
3. Once the application window appears, you'll see a chat interface.

## Using the Chat Interface

1. Type your instructions or description of the Python application you want to build in the text field at the bottom of the window.
2. Press Enter or click the send button (arrow icon) to submit your message.
3. The AI will process your instructions and provide Python code snippets or entire scripts in the chat window.

## Example Instructions

Here are some examples of what you can ask the AI to build:

- "Create a simple web scraper that extracts headlines from a news website"
- "Build a basic Flask API with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users"
- "Generate a Python script that analyzes a CSV file and creates a bar chart of the data"
- "Create a Tkinter GUI application for a todo list manager"
- "Write a Python script that uses multiprocessing to perform parallel computations"

## Tips for Effective Use

1. Be as specific as possible in your instructions to get more accurate and complete code.
2. If you need a particular feature or functionality, mention it explicitly.
3. Feel free to ask for modifications or improvements to the generated code.
4. You can request explanations for specific parts of the code if needed.
